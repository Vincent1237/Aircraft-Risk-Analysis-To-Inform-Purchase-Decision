# Aircraft-Risk-Analysis-To-Inform-Purchase-Decision

## Overview:
-Your company is expanding into aviation and needs to assess aircraft safety risks.
-This presentation provides data-driven insights to help decide on aircraft purchases.


## Business Problem
Your company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. You are charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. You must then translate your findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

### Objectives:
-1.   **Evaluating Aircraft Safety Based on Make and Model**

How does the make and model of an aircraft correlate with the frequency of aviation accidents? Understanding this relationship will provide insights into the safest aircraft models, aiding in more informed acquisition decisions.


2.  **Assessing Accident Risk by Flight Purpose**

What is the distribution of aviation accidents across different flight purposes (e.g., commercial, cargo, private, training)? Identifying high-risk flight purposes will help guide strategic decisions on aircraft procurement and operational planning.


3.  **Geographical Analysis of Aviation Accidents in the U.S.A**

How do aviation accident rates vary across different states in the United States? Analyzing regional accident trends can inform route planning and investment decisions to maximize operational safety and profitability.


4.  **Seasonal Impact on Aviation Accidents and Revenue Optimization**

How do different weather seasons correlate with the number of aviation accidents? Understanding these patterns will help identify safer operational periods and optimize revenue by strategically planning flight schedules.

 **Comments**:
1. Cessna make account to Majority of the Accidents at Circa 2,200 Accidents recorded.
2. Cessna152, Cessna172, Cessna172N involved in most of the accidents
3. Cessna Models dominate accidents charts alluding to the fact that Cessna Make and Model is responsible for Majority
of the Accidents
4. Md Helicopter, Piccard and Money M-20k are the among the most safest Aircrafts

**Comments**:
 1. personal flights forms majority of aviation accidents at approximately 48,000/- Accidents this forms approximately
70% of the sampled 5 purposes
2. Personal Flights Account to Majority of fatalities, this can be attributed to lower security controls and standards
3. Business purpose flight have a lower risk.

**Comments**:
1. California, Texas and Florida Account for Majority Accidents experienced in the Usa
2.Vermont, Rhode Island and Delaware states have minimal Aviation Accidents Recorded.

**Comments**:
1. Most Number of Accident and Most fatalities all happen in the Summer season, with an accident range of 28,000
with a corresonding fatality at 9700 which gives a fatality rate of around 35 percent of the accident numbers
considering that summer is normally clear it can be attributed to laxity from the pilots end.

2.Winter experiences the least number of Accidents and Fatalties, this can infer that fewer people travel over the winter


# Recommendations:

1. *Select Low-Risk Aircraft Makes*: Avoid high-accident aircraft manufacturers like Cessna and Piper. Also focus on Enhanced Pilot Training: Strengthen training programs for student and private pilots, focusing on emergency procedures, situational awareness, and risk management. • 

2. *A significant portion of aviation accidents is attributed to personal flight operations. Unlike Business and Instructional flights, personal flights often involve pilots with varying levels of experience and training, which may contribute to a higher likelihood of human errors. Additionally, these flights may have less stringent regulatory oversight, leading to inconsistent adherence to safety protocols.

To address this issue, it is crucial to enhance safety awareness among private pilots through Stronger Training Requirements, Enhanced Safety Regulations and Risk Awareness Campaigns:

3.Geographical Analysis of Aviation Accidents in the U.S.A California, Texas, and Florida account for the majority of aviation accidents in the United States, while Vermont, Rhode Island, and Delaware have recorded the fewest incidents.

Possible Reasons i. High Air Traffic Volume – These states have some of the busiest airspaces in the country, with numerous commercial, private, and training flights operating daily. ii. Diverse and Challenging Weather Conditions – Frequent thunderstorms, hurricanes, and fog, especially in Florida and Texas, can contribute to higher accident rates. iii. Large Number of Flight Training Schools – States like Florida and Texas are home to many flight schools, increasing the number of student pilots and training-related incidents. iv. Geographical and Economic Factors – These states have vast territories with significant aviation activity, including private, agricultural, and business flights.

Recommendations • Enhanced Safety Regulations: Implement stricter oversight in high-accident states, ensuring compliance with safety protocols for both private and commercial flights. • Targeted Pilot Training Programs: Focus on risk awareness and emergency preparedness, particularly in areas with high air traffic and complex weather patterns. • Improved Air Traffic Management: Invest in air traffic control infrastructure to better handle the large volume of flights and reduce mid-air conflicts.

4.. Seasonal Impact on Aviation Accidents and Revenue Optimization Large proprtion of Accidents and Fatalities happended in the summer when the weather is favorable and clear, this may be due to laxity from the pilots end. To mitigate this, it is essential to upskill the pilots through targeted training and awareness campaigns which emphasize on safety.
